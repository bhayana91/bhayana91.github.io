## What is Arduino ?

* **Open-source** electronics platform 
* Electronic development board for robotics, IoT etc



# Basic programming

## Led Blink

### Code Snippet

```javascript

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);    
}
```

**setup()** is used to initialize variables, libraries, pins. In the example above pin number 13 is initialized, Arduino now knows that it has to work with pin 13.

**pinMode()** is used to set pin as an INPUT/OUPUT.

**loop()** is where Arduino is put to perform an action, in our case blinking an LED on board.

**digitalWrite()** will set the pins to HIGH/LOW mode, HIGH: 5 Volts & LOW: 0 Volts(GND), it assumes that pinMode is initialized with a pin value. In the example above pin 13 has been used.
