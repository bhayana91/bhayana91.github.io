## What is Arduino ?

* **Open-source** electronics platform 
* Electronic development board for robotics, IoT etc



# Basic programming
## Led Blink
### Code Snippet

```javascript

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);    
}
```


**setup()** is used to initialize variables, libraries, pins. In the example above pin number 13 is initialized, Arduino now knows that it has to work with pin 13.


**loop()** is where Arduino is put to perform an action, in our case blinking an LED on board.
